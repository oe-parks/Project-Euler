# Project-Euler

A collection of my solutions to Project Euler problems.

The goal of this repo is to document my progression through the problems 
and my growth in both mathematics and computer science.

Each solution is in its own file (e.g. projeuler1.py) and contains my 
approach to the problem.

**Note:** If you're working through these problems yourself, I'd recommend 
not looking at the solutions.
